The following poem was composed using random quotes from bullshit
said by a few friends and I while we played Warframe over the course
of this application's development.


The Fists, The Dream, and The Grenade Launcher

Fangs and Paris,
An unlimited supply,
You're too slow,
Your fortunes have been denied
